## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**CURRENT TASK: DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

User showed deployment log with warnings about missing environment variables. The deployment was successful but needed environment variable configuration.

### üö® Deployment Warnings Identified:

1. **PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT**: Variable not set (defaulting to blank string)
2. **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**: Variable not set (defaulting to blank string)
3. **Docker Compose Version**: Obsolete version attribute warning

### üîç Root Cause Analysis:

The `.env` file exists but contains placeholder values instead of actual environment variables:

- `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=medical-knowledge`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here`

### ‚úÖ Solutions Applied:

1. **Fixed Docker Compose Warning**: Removed obsolete `version: "3.8"` attribute from docker-compose.yml
2. **Identified Environment Variable Issue**: Documented that `.env` file contains placeholder values

### üìã Production Deployment Requirements:

**For Production Deployment**, the user needs to:

1. **Update `.env` file** with actual values:

   - Replace `your_pinecone_environment_here` with actual Pinecone environment
   - Replace `your_secure_password_here` with secure PostgreSQL password
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with actual OpenAI API key
   - Replace `your_pinecone_api_key_here` with actual Pinecone API key
   - Replace `your_secret_key_here` with secure secret key

2. **For Development/Testing**, the current setup works but shows warnings

### üéØ Deployment Status:

- **Containers**: Successfully created and started
- **Services**: Both cds-backend and postgres containers running
